Opinion polling for the next United Kingdom general election is being carried out continually by various organisations to gauge voting intention. Most of the polling companies listed are members of the British Polling Council (BPC) and abide by its disclosure rules. The dates for these opinion polls range from the 2019 general election on 12 December to the present day.

Under the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, the next general election must be held no later than 28 January 2025. The Act mandates that, if it has not already been dissolved at the request of the prime minister, Parliament automatically dissolves five years after it first met (17 December 2024) and polling day occurs no more than 25 working days later.
Graphical summary

The chart below shows opinion polls conducted for the next United Kingdom general election. The trend lines are local regressions (LOESS).
National poll results

Poll results are listed in the table below in reverse chronological order. The highest percentage figure in each poll is displayed in bold, and its background is shaded in the leading party's colour. The "lead" column shows the percentage point difference between the two parties with the highest figures. When a poll result is a tie, the figures with the highest percentages are shaded and displayed in bold.

Most opinion polls do not cover Northern Ireland, which has different major political parties from the rest of the United Kingdom. This distinction is made in the table below in the area column, where "GB" means Great Britain, which is made up of England, Scotland and Wales, and excludes Northern Ireland, and "UK" means United Kingdom, which includes Northern Ireland. Plaid Cymru only stand candidates in Wales and the SNP only stand candidates in Scotland. The parties with the greatest numbers of votes in the 2019 general election are listed here. Other parties are listed in the "Others" column.

"Green" in these tables refers to combined totals for the green parties in the United Kingdom, namely the Green Party of England and Wales, the Scottish Greens, and, for polls of the entire UK, the Green Party Northern Ireland. The three parties share a commitment to environmental policies, but are independent of one another, with each contesting elections only in its own region.

The polling company ComRes was acquired by Savanta in July 2019.[1] It was rebranded as Savanta ComRes in November 2019[2] and as Savanta in December 2022.[3] In August 2023 the market research company Omnisis rebranded its public polling arm as We Think.[4] In October 2023, the Norstat group acquired Panelbase.[5] None of these organisational changes entailed changes in methodology.

Seat predictions

Most polls are reported in terms of the overall popular vote share, and the pollsters do not typically project how these shares would equate to numbers of seats in the House of Commons. Other organisations including Electoral Calculus make rolling projections based on an aggregate of publicly available polls and provide a methodology whereby vote share numbers can be translated to a prediction of seat numbers.

Tabulated below are the outputs from large polls have been carried out to run multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) models, which yield predictions for each constituency.[33]

In the 650-seat House of Commons, 326 seats are needed for a parliamentary majority. Negative values in the rightmost column below indicate that the party with the most seats would not have a majority.

Notes

The headline voting intention figures are calculated by YouGov from its MRP seat projections.
Values calculated from the weighted responses for each party, after excluding Don't Know and Would Not Vote.
The published lead was 15 points. This is not apparent from the party numbers due to rounding.
Including Plaid Cymru
Survation also polled voting intention if Liz Truss were Prime Minister, which saw Labour on 46%, the Conservatives on 29%, Liberal Democrats on 11% and others on 12%.
Opinium announced they had amended their methodology, so it cannot be compared directly to previous Opinium polls.
SNP and Plaid Cymru are listed together.
First MRP to take into account new constituency boundaries
"The baseline MRP by Focaldata predicted Labour winning 469 seats and the Conservatives 128 seats. 'Don't Know' was predicted to win two seats, namely Aberdeenshire North and Moray East; as well as Boston and Skegness. Given in a General Election scenario 'Don't Know' would not be on the ballot paper, we reallocated these seats to the party in second place. This meant that we awarded Aberdeenshire North and Moray East to the Labour Party; and then Boston and Skegness to the Conservatives in all scenarios and analyses that we performed."
This includes the 18 seats of Northern Ireland. No polling in Northern Ireland was conducted as part of this poll.
2 Reform UK, 1 Other
10,010 sample, 20–26 October 2022; 2,000 sample, 28–30 October 2022.[34] "The MRP poll by Focaldata of 10,010 people, on behalf of the internationalist campaign group Best for Britain, was conducted about the time of Truss's resignation and updated with an MRP poll of 2,000 people after Sunak took over."[35]
517 listed; one seat (Clacton) is reported as "Don't Know", but "in reality the seat would be won by Labour", and is therefore added to Labour's projected total seat count.[34]
Polling was of GB adults only, but 18 seats were assigned to "Northern Ireland Parties" — without differentiation — in the reporting of the MRP's outcome
This includes the 18 seats of Northern Ireland. No polling in Northern Ireland was conducted as part of this poll.
Jonathan Edwards is the incumbent MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, elected as a Plaid MP. He was suspended from the party after being arrested for domestic assault.[47]
Notional result[48]
Poll conducted based on the previous boundaries for this constituency, not the boundaries used at the general election.
They also conducted a poll in the scenario that Farage was the Reform UK candidate, which found Reform UK at 38%, Conservatives at 27%, and Labour at 23%
These are: Bournemouth East, Chelsea and Fulham, Cheltenham, Chingford and Woodford Green, Chippenham, Chipping Barnet, Cities of London and Westminster, Colchester, Esher and Walton, Filton and Bradley Stoke, Finchley and Golders Green, Guildford, Harrow East, Hendon, Henley, Hitchin and Harpenden, Lewes, Milton Keynes North, Milton Keynes South, Mole Valley, Reading West, Romsey and Southampton North, South Cambridgeshire, South East Cambridgeshire, South West Surrey, St Ives, Sutton and Cheam, Taunton Deane, Thornbury and Yate, Totnes, Truro and Falmouth, Tunbridge Wells, Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Wantage, Watford, Wells, West Dorset, Wimbledon, Winchester, Woking, Wokingham, and Wycombe.

    Results of poll displayed "a 17-point swing to Labour compared with 2019"
